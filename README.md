Optimizing Bank Telemarketing Campaigns: Predictive Modeling in R Studio
This report focuses on analyzing and building predictive models using a real-world dataset from a Portuguese bank's telemarketing campaign. The primary goal is to identify which customers are most likely to subscribe to term deposits, helping the bank optimize resource allocation and improve campaign success rates. The project involves cleaning and transforming the data, performing exploratory data analysis, and applying various machine learning models such as logistic regression, decision trees, and Na√Øve Bayes. Model performance is evaluated using metrics like AUC and MSE, with logistic regression using hand-selected variables emerging as the most effective. The report also discusses limitations, such as low sensitivity and practical challenges, and provides recommendations for improving predictive accuracy in future campaigns.
